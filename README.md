Overview

This project implements an optimized business process for an e-commerce system. It focuses on the following key processes:

    Order Processing
    Payment Gateway Integration
    Customer Support Workflow
    Shipping and Fulfillment

Features

    Order Processing: Simulates checking inventory and processing orders.
    Payment Gateway: Mock implementation of a payment gateway to simulate payment processing.
    Customer Support: Handles customer issues via support tickets.
    Shipping and Fulfillment: Simulates the shipping process and updates order statuses.

Technology Stack

    Language: Python
    Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub

How to Run the System

    Install Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

    Clone the Repository: Once uploaded to GitHub, clone the repository using:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>

Run the Script: Execute the main script (ecommerce.py or the file name you save this code as):

    python ecommerce.py

    Expected Output: The script will simulate the full e-commerce process:
        Process an order.
        Handle payment (random success/failure).
        Fulfill the order (shipping).
        Resolve a customer support ticket.
